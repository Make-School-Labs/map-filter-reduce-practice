## Instructions

1. Clone the Repository to your computer.
2. Run `git remote remove origin` to disconnect from the class repo. Also, run `npm install` to install any necessary packages included in `package.json`.
3. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and create a new repository for your code (do not initialize with a README). Follow the instructions to add a new remote called 'origin' to your new repository.
4. Navigate to each of the two Challenge files - `challenges1.js` and `challenges2.js` - and follow the instructions before each practice activity.
5. The data from the People dataset and Instruments dataset - `people.js` and `instruments` - is stored as an array of objects. Each object in the array has the same fields with different values.

## Running Your Code

- From the root directory, run all the challenges with:

```bash
    npm test
```

- To run a specific challenge file

For challenge 1:

```bash
    npm run challenge1
```

For challenge 2:

```bash
    npm run challenge2
```
